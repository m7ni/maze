The assignment covers topics such as fork, processes, executing other processes, threads, data synchronization using mutex, critical sections, and employs the ncurses library for the graphical interface. The assignment has received a perfect score of 100 out of 100.

## Assignment Summary

The Maze Game Assignment focuses on building a maze-based game that explores fundamental concepts in operating systems. The assignment covers the following topics:

- **Fork:** Understanding and utilizing the fork system call to create new processes.
- **Processes:** Managing multiple processes to handle different aspects of the game.
- **Executing Other Processes:** Integrating the ability to execute other processes within the game environment.
- **Threads:** Implementing threads to handle concurrent tasks and enhance performance.
- **Data Synchronization (Mutex):** Using mutex to ensure proper synchronization and prevent data conflicts in a multi-threaded environment.
- **Critical Sections:** Managing critical sections of the code to avoid race conditions and ensure data integrity.
- **Ncurses for GUI-like interface:** Utilizing the ncurses library to create a text-based graphical interface for the game.
